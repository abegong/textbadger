Textbadger is a heavily ajaxed Django application built for collaborative content analysis. It is (currently) best run in a walled environment, it should not be run on a server directly accessible to the public. Textbadger is mostly finished, but is still somewhat rough around the edges. Installation instructions can be found in the dev folder.



Textbadger's tables can be sorted on multiple columns, just click the heading of the primary column then shift-click any secondary column(s).
